    DESCRIPTION:

    INPUT: The first line of the input data contains numbers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50), 
           n — amount of lines, and m — amount of columns on Bob's sheet. The following 
           n lines contain m characters each. Character «.» stands for a non-shaded 
           square on the sheet, and «*» — for a shaded square. It is guaranteed that Bob 
           has shaded at least one square.

    OUTPUT: Output the required rectangle of the minimum cost. Study the output data in 
            the sample tests to understand the output format better.
